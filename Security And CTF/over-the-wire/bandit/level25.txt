Task:
    Logging in to bandit26 from bandit25 should be fairly easyâ€¦ The shell for user bandit26 is not /bin/bash, but something else. Find out what it is, how it works and how to break out of it.
    
Command:
    ssh -p 2220 -i 25.sshkey.private bandit26@bandit.labs.overthewire.org 

Notes:
    Umm, wtf was this level
    So, we had to shrink our screen down to the point where we can get the more trigger
    Then while in more we have to press v to go into vim mode
    then in vim press escape and type in :e /etc/bandit_pass/bandit26
