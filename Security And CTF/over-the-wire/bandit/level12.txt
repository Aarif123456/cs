Task:
    The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which is a hexdump of a file that has been repeatedly compressed. For this level it may be useful to create a directory under /tmp in which you can work using mkdir. For example: mkdir /tmp/myname123. Then copy the datafile using cp, and rename it using mv (read the manpages!)

Command:
    mkdir /tmp/kazekage # make file
    cp data.txt /tmp/kazekage # copy over
    cd /tmp/kazekage # move there
    xxd -r data.txt > 1.txt # get back file from hexadump
    file 1.txt # reveals that it was gzipped
    gunzip --force 1.gz
    file 1.bz2 # reveals that it was bunzipped
    bunzip2 1.bz2
