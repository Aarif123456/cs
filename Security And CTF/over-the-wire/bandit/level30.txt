Task:
    There is a git repository at ssh://bandit30-git@localhost/home/bandit30-git/repo. The password for the user bandit30-git is the same as for the user bandit30.

Command:
    git clone ssh://bandit30-git@bandit.labs.overthewire.org:2220/home/bandit30-git/repo
    git show-ref --tags # shows the commit
    git show secret # actually shows the commit

Notes:
    this was kind of dumb
    First you had to recognize we had secret tag - which is fine
    Then u had to figure out how to show the commit
