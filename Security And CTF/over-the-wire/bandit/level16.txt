Task:
    The credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to a port on localhost in the range 31000 to 32000. First find out which of these ports have a server listening on them. Then find out which of those speak SSL and which donâ€™t. There is only 1 server that will give the next credentials, the others will simply send back to you whatever you send to it.

Command:
    nmap -p31000-32000 localhost
    ports=(31046 31518 31691 31790 31960)
    for i in "${ports[@]}"
    do
       echo "$i"
       echo "cluFn7wTiGryunymYOu4RcffSxQluehd" | timeout 5 nc localhost "$i"
    done
    # The above loop revealed that 31790 is different
    openssl s_client -connect localhost:31790

Notes:
    We could use cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit16 | openssl s_client -connect localhost:31790 -quiet
