Task:
    The password for the next level is stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 and can only be read by user bandit14. For this level, you donâ€™t get the next password, but you get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level. Note: localhost is a hostname that refers to the machine you are working on

Command:
    cat sshkey.private # We can copy key locally and just use it to connect

Notes:  
    ssh -p 2220 -i 13.sshkey.private bandit14@bandit.labs.overthewire.org

Password: 4wcYUJFw0k0XLShlDzztnTBHiqxU3b3e - we don't need it to get access to next level
