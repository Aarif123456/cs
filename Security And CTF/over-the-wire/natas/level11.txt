Task:
    Looking at the source code we have json_enocded array which was encrypted by an xor key.

    e.g.
    let pt = the data
    let k = the xor key
    let cp = the cipher text - the encrypted data

    cp = pt ^ k
    cp ^ k = pt ^ k ^ k
    k ^ cp = pt
    k ^ cp ^ cp = pt^ cp
    k = pt^ cp
    k = cp ^ pt


Solution:
    Find the xor key as described above. Then create the desired data and encrypt using the same algorithm.
