3 cases
1. empty list- new node points to self
2. node new head - if data is less than head- our new node is our head
    - create pointer to go around till next element is head 
        - make that element point to our node 
        - make this node point to our head 
        - make this node our head
3. normal case
    - find spot where data is less than our current node
    - now go from head - till our next node is the node we found in the last step
    - same steps - from case 2
