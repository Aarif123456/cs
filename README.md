# Toy Repo

The point of this repo is to hold smaller projects that I don't think need their own repo.

1. AI - small AI related code and assignments
2. Algorithms - implementation of algorithms I learned. I will normally put some problems with them to show they actually work
3. Big Data - Data analytics/big data based algorithm
4. Data Structures - implementation of data structures
5. Hardware - anything hardware based or OS based
6. Networking - networking based algorithms and concepts
7. Security and CTF - code/walk though of CTFS
